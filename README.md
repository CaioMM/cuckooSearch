# Cucko Search Algorithm
---

## 1. Description

### Meta-heuristic inspired by cucko bird 
1. The bird lay eggs in host nest
2. The Host can find the egg with a specific probability
3. If the host find the cucko egg it can leave the nest or throw away the egg
---

## 2. How To Use
* It's necessary to adjust the fitness code present in .\Utils\fitness.m
* Insert there the function to be optimized.
